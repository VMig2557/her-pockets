      Hey ladies, do you hate having to carry a bag at all times? Are you tired
      of your husband and boyfriend whining like little babies because they have
      to carry your phone, wallet, and keys? Are you maybe even a little
      <em>jealous</em> of the guys and those big, practical pockets they have in
      every article of clothing? Well, girl, say “Hello” to the whole new World
      of <strong class="her-green"><em>Her</em> Pockets!</strong>
    </p>
