# Her Pockets! ‚Äì A Website-Building Adventure

**_Her_ Pockets!** is a(n) X-part exercise in creating a website for the (sadly) fictional fashion startup **_Her_ Pockets!** that is seeking to change the world by providing women with clothing that marries the best in high fashion with the practical carrying capacity found in even the most basic men's attire.

Starting files for each Day's task are provided in the corresponding subdirectory under `/src`. Both an example of _a_ solution for each Day's task and a step-by-step walkthrough are available in the `/answers` directory.

I hope you enjoy the adventure!

# Welcome to **_Her_ Pockets!**

You're the newest hire at **_Her_ Pockets!**, a direct-to-consumer clothing company that is solving one of the world's great problems by providing women with clothes that actually include pockets. As a Junior Web Developer at **_Her_ Pockets!**, you'll be helping out the website team in getting the website (NotYourPocket.coffee [not a real site üò≠]) ready for launch at the end of the week.

# Day 1

It's your first day at **_Her_ Pockets!** You've been tasked with creating the "**_Her_ Difference!**" page, which you've been told is for demonstrating the differences between **_Her_ Pockets!** and the competition.

Your supervisor has instructed you that you only need to create the main content of the page. Ted, another developer on the team, has been assigned to work on the header, footer, and navigation, so you don't need to worry about them.

The "**_Her_ Difference!**" page needs to have a main heading, a paragraph promoting **_Her_ Pockets!**'s **_Her_ Difference!**, and a table comparing the pockets of the **_Her_ Pockets!** clothing catalog to the competition. The text for these elements is provided below.

Just as you're sitting down at your desk to begin working, the company's lead designer drops by your desk and hands you a note with a simple style guide written in mint-green crayon. She explains that these requirements are _essential_ to the **_Her_ Pockets!** Brand identity, so you'd better not mess them up.
